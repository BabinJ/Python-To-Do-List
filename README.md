# Python-To-Do-List

In an effort to dust off my grad school python learning, I've decided to embark on a series of projects of increasing complexity. Each will begin with building the simplest version of the application/tool. The code will then be refined for readability and efficiency. Finally, the application will be implemented with a GUI. 

The first of these projects is a To Do list. The tasks will be written to (and upon program open, read from) an external .csv file. The data will be handled within a Pandas dataframe.
